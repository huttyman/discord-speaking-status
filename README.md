# Discord Speaking Status
Relays speaking status in a discord voice channel from a https://streamkit.discord.com/ tab.

Outlines user character token and their user color marker in the players ui when they speak.

Must be used in browser. Will not work with the Foundry VTT desktop application.

Until the extension is published on the chrome web store, you must install the necessary extension by extracting discord-speaking-relay.zip, enable developer mode in your chrome based browser, and load it as an unpacked extension.
